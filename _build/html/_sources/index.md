# Data-Driven Methods in Finance

The Data-Driven Methods in Finance (DDMIF) course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive education in using data for quantitative research in finance and trading. The course aims to equip students with the necessary skills to make informed, data-driven decisions and optimize information in finance. The curriculum is based on multiple sources, with a primary focus on the books [Active Portfolio Management](https://www.amazon.com/Active-Portfolio-Management-Quantitative-Controlling/dp/0070248826/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=active+portfolio+management+grinold+and+kahn&qid=1677301448&sprefix=active+port%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840), [Advances in Active Portfolio Management](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Active-Portfolio-Management-Econometrics/dp/1260453715/ref=pd_bxgy_vft_high_img_sccl_1/147-4751996-2441805?pd_rd_w=gM3FX&content-id=amzn1.sym.7f0cf323-50c6-49e3-b3f9-63546bb79c92&pf_rd_p=7f0cf323-50c6-49e3-b3f9-63546bb79c92&pf_rd_r=6WC0H4XNJFFGN3MQ9EXK&pd_rd_wg=NOMv6&pd_rd_r=3a756b3b-ac18-4719-bbd7-5f65a96fac89&pd_rd_i=1260453715&psc=1), and [Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management](https://ludwigbc.com/books/qepm-2/).

In addition to the primary textbooks, the course also draws on resources from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) and [Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics](https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/), providing students with a solid foundation in statistical learning techniques and their applications in various fields, including finance.

To support the learning process, the course uses data from various sources, such as [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/), [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/), and [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). However, only established financial strategies, textbook algorithms, open-source software, and freely available datasets will be discussed and used in class. The course is computer-intensive and requires a basic working knowledge of Python, including Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Moreover, a background in linear algebra, probability, and statistics is required, and familiarity with Operation Research topics, web scraping (e.g., [Beautifulsoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), optimization packages (e.g., [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) or [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)), and the Google Colab environment is recommended.

The course covers various topics, including sample statistics, forecasting, machine learning methods, data scraping, and MLOps, focusing on the main data science workflow of generating ideas, sourcing information, extracting features, combining signals, optimizing decisions, and evaluating performance. The course also includes an in-class real-time financial forecasting competition, similar to the [M6 competition](https://m6competition.com/), where students will be asked to augment open-source financial data with external open-source datasets of their choice. They will present their findings to the class by the end of the course, and the competition will evaluate their ability to estimate future returns and uncertainty, combine estimates into an investment decision, follow a consistent investment strategy, properly use alternative datasets, work effectively in teams, be transparent, and learn from mistakes. Winning students are guaranteed an A and a special prize.

The DDMIF course is currently being offered at the [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/faculty/naftali-cohen) department at Columbia University. The course material has been developed and refined over time, drawing upon the instructor's extensive experience in teaching related courses in the past. The material has evolved from previous courses on Operations Research and Optimization that were taught at the [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/naftali-cohen) of New York University.

### Disclaimer
**The course material is solely based on the mentioned textbooks** and does not provide any investment advice or pre-constructed trading algorithms. The views expressed in the course do not necessarily represent those of the author, affiliated entities, or agencies. The objective of the course is to highlight the challenges that arise when applying Data Science and Machine Learning methods to financial data. These challenges, such as a brief history, non-stationarity, shifts in market conditions, and low signal content, make it difficult to achieve robust results. The topics covered in the course provide a reference for using these methods to make informed investment decisions in a systematic and scientific manner.
