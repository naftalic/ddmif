# Data-Driven Methods in Finance

The Data-Driven Methods in Finance (DDMIF) course is a comprehensive education in using data for quantitative research in finance and trading. It aims to provide students with the skills necessary to make informed, data-driven decisions and optimize information in finance. The curriculum is based on multiple sources, including [Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management](https://ludwigbc.com/books/qepm-2/), [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/), [Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics](https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/), and other resources.

To support the learning process, the course uses data from various sources, such as [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/), [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/), and [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). However, only established financial strategies, textbook algorithms, open-source software, and freely available datasets will be discussed and used in class. The course is computer-intensive and requires a basic working knowledge of Python, including Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. A background in linear algebra, probability, and statistics is also required, and familiarity with Operation Research topics, web scraping (e.g., [Beautifulsoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), optimization packages (e.g., [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) or [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)), and the Google Colab environment is recommended.

The DDMIF course covers a variety of essential topics, including sample statistics, forecasting, machine learning methods, data scraping, and MLOps. It focuses on the main data science workflow, which involves generating ideas, sourcing information, extracting features, combining signals, optimizing decisions, and evaluating performance. One unique aspect of the course is an in-class real-time financial forecasting competition, similar to the [M6 competition](https://m6competition.com/). This competition provides students with valuable hands-on experience and prepares them to apply their learning in real-world financial situations.

The DDMIF course is currently offered at the [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department at Columbia University](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu). The material has been developed and refined over time, drawing upon the instructor's extensive experience in teaching related courses in the past. The material has evolved from previous courses on Operations Research and Optimization taught at the [Tandon School of Engineering of New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu).

### Disclaimer
**The course material is solely based on the mentioned textbooks** and does not provide any investment advice or pre-constructed trading algorithms. The views expressed in the course do not necessarily represent those of the author, affiliated entities, or agencies. The objective of the course is to highlight the challenges that arise when applying Data Science and Machine Learning methods to financial data. These challenges, such as a brief history, non-stationarity, shifts in market conditions, and low signal content, make it difficult to achieve robust results. The topics covered in the course provide a reference for using these methods to make informed investment decisions in a systematic and scientific manner.
