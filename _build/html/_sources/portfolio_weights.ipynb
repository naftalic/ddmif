    "# 7) Portfolio Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we discussed various ideas for stock selection that are crucial in identifying good and bad stocks. However, constructing a portfolio requires more than just identifying individual stocks. A skilled manager needs to assign relative weights to the stocks to create a cohesive portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to generate stock weights, ranging from simple methods like equal weighting or market capitalization weighting to more complex techniques based on modern portfolio theory. For portfolio managers who manage against a benchmark, there are additional weighting possibilities, such as ensuring the weighted-average factor exposures of the portfolio match those of the benchmark or maximizing excess expected return while limiting tracking error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize tracking error or risk when weighting stocks, the manager needs to know each stock's expected return, risk or variance, and covariances among stocks. Additionally, the manager may want to impose constraints on the portfolio creation process, such as prohibiting short sales or upholding diversification rules. The manager can then use a quadratic optimizer to determine the optimal weights for the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Risk of Portfolio Measure\n",
    "In finance, the risk of an investment is typically defined as the likelihood of losing money or not achieving the expected return. One way to quantify the risk of a portfolio of stocks is by using the variance or standard deviation of the portfolio returns, which reflects the degree of dispersion or variability of those returns around their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix, Σ, represents the pairwise relationships between the returns of the individual stocks in the portfolio. Specifically, the $(i,j)$th element of Σ is the covariance between the returns of stocks $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$w$ is a vector of portfolio weights, where $w_i$ is the weight of stock $i$ in the portfolio. The product $w^TΣw$ gives the portfolio variance, which is a measure of the risk of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of why $w^TΣw$ is a measure of risk for portfolios of 1, 2, and 3 stocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio of one stock:\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio consisting of only one stock. In this case, the portfolio variance simplifies to the variance of the single stock multiplied by the square of its weight in the portfolio. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w^TΣw = w_1^2σ_1^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $σ_1^2$ is the variance of the single stock.\n",
    "The higher the variance of the stock, the higher the risk of the portfolio. Similarly, if the weight of the stock in the portfolio is high, then the portfolio variance will be higher and the risk will also be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio of two stocks:\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio consisting of two stocks with weights $w_1$ and $w_2$. In this case, the portfolio variance is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w^TΣw &= w_1^2σ_1^2 + w_2^2σ_2^2 + 2w_1w_2σ_{1,2}\\\\\n",
    "&= w_1^2σ_1^2 + w_2^2σ_2^2 + 2w_1w_2ρ_{1,2}σ_1σ_2\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ρ_{1,2}$ is the correlation coefficient between the returns of stocks 1 and 2.\n",
    "The portfolio variance depends on the variances of the individual stocks as well as the covariance between them. If the two stocks are highly positively correlated (i.e., the covariance between them is positive), then the portfolio variance will be higher, indicating higher risk. Conversely, if the two stocks are highly negatively correlated (i.e., the covariance between them is negative), then the portfolio variance will be lower, indicating lower risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio of three stocks:\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio consisting of three stocks with weights $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$. In this case, the portfolio variance is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w^TΣw &= w_1^2σ_1^2 + w_2^2σ_2^2 + w_3^2σ_3^2 + 2w_1w_2σ_{1,2} + 2w_1w_3σ_{1,3} + 2w_2w_3σ_{2,3}\\\\\n",
    "&=w_1^2σ_1^2 + w_2^2σ_2^2 + w_3^2σ_3^2 + 2w_1w_2ρ_{1,2}σ_1σ_2 + 2w_1w_3ρ_{1,3}σ_1σ_3 + 2w_2w_3ρ_{2,3}σ_2σ_3\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ρ_{1,2}$, $ρ_{1,3}$, and $ρ_{2,3}$ are the correlation coefficients between the returns of stocks 1 and 2, stocks 1 and 3, and stocks 2 and 3, respectively.\n",
    "The portfolio variance now depends on the variances of the individual stocks as well as the covariances between all possible pairs of stocks. The risk of the portfolio will depend on the strengths and directions of these pairwise relationships. If the three stocks are all positively correlated, for example, then the portfolio variance and risk will be higher than if the stocks are negatively correlated or uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue by discussing two methods for creating a portfolio that is not managed against a benchmark: informal methods that use rules of thumb to weight stocks and the mean-variance optimization method, which minimizes the portfolio's total risk given its expected return. We then explore the four potential approaches to creating a portfolio that is managed against a specific benchmark, including informal weighting methods, stratification, factor exposure targeting, and tracking-error minimization. Of these techniques, only those that minimize risk have theoretical rigor, but they also require a larger skill set, more time, and more effort than the less quantitatively precise methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Informal methods\n",
    "After selecting the stocks for a portfolio, there are several informal methods for determining the portfolio weights. The two most common are equal weighting and value weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal weighting assigns the same weight to every stock, regardless of market capitalization or other factors. For example, if there are 10 stocks in the portfolio, each stock will have a weight of 0.1 (= 1/10). While this approach is simple and quick, it does not consider the expected returns or risks of the stocks and may not be suitable for portfolios where such information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value weighting, on the other hand, assigns weights proportional to the stocks' market capitalizations. For example, if the market capitalization of stock A is twice as great as that of stock B, then the weight of stock A will also be twice the weight of stock B. This method ensures that the portfolio's performance matches that of the market average, but it still does not reflect the expected returns or risks of individual stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are variations of value weighting, such as weighting stocks by the square root or cube root of their market capitalization, which reduces bias towards large stocks. Another informal weighting method is price weighting, where the portfolio manager buys the same number of shares in each stock so that the weights are proportional to the stock prices. This is how the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei 225 are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other informal weighting methods may be used for benchmarked portfolios, which will be discussed later. Ultimately, the choice of weighting method will depend on the portfolio manager's information and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mean-variance optimization method\n",
    "Standard Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) is a technique used to identify the portfolio with the lowest risk given the mean and variance of future stock returns. To accomplish this, we theoretically compare the **ex-ante** risks and **expected** returns of all potential portfolios with identical expected returns, computed from the variances and covariances of the returns of all stocks. Quadratic programming is then used to find the minimum-risk portfolio without the need to calculate every portfolio's risk and return explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, MVO has its limitations, as estimation errors could result in overweighting certain outlier stocks with low variances or high means. To mitigate this risk, additional portfolio constraints, such as short-sale, diversification, or sector constraints, may be imposed to limit the maximum and minimum stock weights. It is crucial to strike a balance between the constraints to avoid contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio manager's role is to carefully evaluate the estimation errors and decide on the necessary constraints, while allowing the optimizer to handle the rest. Nonetheless, caution must be taken not to over-constrain the portfolio and avoid hindering the full investment of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## No constraints\n",
    "Using MVO without any additional constraints requires building a model of expected stock returns and risk, either by utilizing previously discussed models or by using commercial software models in combination with excess-return models. The portfolio manager begins by incorporating all relevant information about individual stock returns into a column vector μ and a matrix Σ, where μ represents the expected returns of individual stocks and Σ represents the variances and covariances of individual stock returns. \n",
    "Thus,\n",

    "A valid portfolio is specified by an $N$-dimensional column vector of stock weights, $w$, where the weight of each stock is represented by $w_i$. The sum of all elements in w must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected return of the portfolio is given by $w^\\top μ$, while the risk of the portfolio is represented by $w^\\top Σw$, where $w^\\top$ represents the transpose of the weight vector. The portfolio with the minimum risk and expected return of $μ_P$ is obtained by minimizing the objective function $w^\\top Σw$ while satisfying the constraint $w^\\top μ = μ_P$. This is a quadratic optimization problem, and mathematicians have developed quadratic programming to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic minimization problem with **equality** constraints can be rewritten as a set of linear constraints, which have a **closed-form** solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a minimal-risk portfolio for a given level of expected return, we begin the optimization procedure using the expected return of the lowest expected return stock. We increment the mean return and repeat the optimization until we reach the expected return of the security with the highest mean return. We plot all the points in the diagram and connect them to produce the efficient frontier. The expected-return–expected-risk profile we desire can then be selected from the efficient frontier, and we can pick the weights of the corresponding stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short-Sale and Diversification Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment portfolio managers may face various constraints, such as legal restrictions or prospectus mandates, that limit their investment options. One of the main constraints faced by long-only portfolio managers is the short-sale restriction, which prohibits shorting securities. Mathematically, this restriction can be represented as the condition that each stock has a weight of at least zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w\\ge 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is an inequality constraint, and quadratic optimization problems with inequality constraints do not have a simple analytical solution, requiring numerical methods instead. Techniques designed to solve these types of problems are known as quadratic programming, which can be easily entered into commercial software or a quadratic optimizer.\n",
    "When using the same data as before and applying quadratic optimization programming with short-sale constraints, the efficient frontier shifts to the right. This is because the additional constraint increases the lowest-risk portfolio's risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to short-sale constraints, portfolio managers may also want to impose diversification constraints to comply with the [Investment Company Act of 1940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Company_Act_of_1940) or to reduce diversifiable risk. Such constraints can be expressed as maximum and minimum allowed weight vectors and added easily to the optimization problem, satisfying both the short-sale and diversification constraints simultaneously.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\underline w \\le w \\le \\overline w\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\underline w$ and $\\overline w$  are $N$-dimensional vectors of minimum and maximum allowed weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sector or Industry Constraints\n",
    "Portfolio managers, particularly those who manage against a benchmark, often aim to limit the sector weightings of their portfolio. To achieve this, a straightforward modification can be made to the framework by constraining the sector weightings using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\underline w_j \\le w_j \\le \\overline w_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading-Volume Constraint\n",
    "One common constraint added to optimization by portfolio managers is the trading-volume constraint, which is particularly relevant when managing large portfolios that could have a significant price impact on the market. To avoid negative price impact, portfolio managers may restrict the holdings of each stock to a certain threshold amount, often a fraction of the average trading volume of each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a portfolio is valued at $500 million and the manager wishes to keep the holding of one stock below 10% of its average daily trading volume (ADV), the constraint can be expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "500w_i \\le 0.1x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i$ is the portfolio weight of stock $i$ and $x_i$ is the average trading volume of stock $i$ measured in millions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk-Adjusted Return\n",
    "In the previous section, we presented the mean-variance optimization problem as a risk minimization problem. However, some portfolio managers may prefer an alternative formulation that focuses on expected return maximization instead. This can be expressed as follows: maximize $μ_P$ subject to other constraints.\n",
    "The expected return maximization formulation may be more useful if the portfolio manager has a specific target risk level $σ_P$, while the risk minimization may be more appropriate if the portfolio manager has a target expected return.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& \\max\\limits_w w^\\top\\mu\\quad &\\text{s.t.} \\quad & w^\\top\\Sigma w = \\sigma_P, \\quad \\text{or}\\\\ \n",
    "& \\min\\limits_w w^\\top\\Sigma w &\\text{s.t.} \\quad & w^\\top\\mu = \\mu_P.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the portfolio manager has neither a target risk nor a target expected return, the mean-variance optimization can be expressed in terms of risk-adjusted expected return. This can be achieved by adjusting the expected return for the risk, which is done by subtracting some multiple of the risk, i.e., $μ_P - Aσ^2$. Here, A is the risk-aversion parameter, and a high value of A indicates that the portfolio manager considers the risk to be very costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the value of A is 2, it means that the portfolio manager equates a 1% increase in the variance with a 2% decrease in the expected return. Once the value of the risk-aversion parameter is determined, the mean-variance problem can be formulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max\\limits_w μ_P - Aσ^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation can be useful in certain applications, as it allows the portfolio manager to balance the trade-off between expected return and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benchmark\n",
    "Benchmarking is a common practice for portfolio managers. While some managers strictly adhere to the benchmark, known as index managers, others take a more flexible approach and are called active or enhanced index managers. **The aim of active managers is to generate returns that exceed the benchmark while maintaining a portfolio that is broadly similar to it**. Striking a balance between outperforming the benchmark and adhering to it can be challenging, but it becomes easier when the benchmark is not efficient. To achieve outperformance, managers can utilize various techniques such as informal methods, stratification, factor exposure targeting, and tracking error minimization. Among these, the most popular method is tracking error minimization, as it offers the highest level of risk control while still giving the manager the freedom to select preferred stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Informal\n",
    "One way to make sure that a benchmarked portfolio closely follows its benchmark is to use a simple weighting approach. This involves selecting the biggest holdings in the benchmark and including them in the portfolio. For example, if the portfolio is meant to have 50 stocks, the 50 stocks with the biggest market capitalization in the benchmark could be chosen. The weights of these 50 stocks can then be calculated based on their relative market capitalizations. If desired, a manager could adjust the weights slightly to favor their preferred stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods to adjust the weights to favor preferred stocks. Assuming that the portfolio manager has ranked stocks using the aggregate z-score methodology explained earlier, the manager should renormalize the aggregate z-scores such that the sum of the z-scores of the chosen subset of 50 stocks (or any number of stocks selected) is equal to zero. To modify the relative market capitalization weighting, the following steps should be taken: First, the manager must determine the maximum percentage deviation in weight that they are willing to allow from the market-cap weighting for the highest absolute z-score value. This value is denoted as η. Second, the manager should identify the highest absolute z-score of all the stocks within the 50-stock universe by taking the absolute value of all individual z-scores and finding the maximum, which is denoted as $z_\\text{max}$. Third, the z-score multiplier should be computed as $m = η/z_\\text{max}$. Finally, the new weights of the portfolio can be calculated using the formula $(w_i + mz_i)$, where $w_i$ represents the relative market capitalization weight within the benchmark. After following these steps, the adjusted portfolio is ready. Note that this procedure works as $\\sum\\limits_i(w_i + mz_i)=\\sum\\limits_i(w_i) + (η/z_\\text{max})\\sum\\limits_iz_i=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although selecting the biggest holdings of the benchmark for a portfolio is one way to track the benchmark, it is not the best solution. This method does not take into account the minimum tracking error versus the index, nor does it control for other risk factors or asset-specific risk. Additionally, the small number of stocks in the portfolio represents only a fraction of the benchmark's total market capitalization, making it an inefficient approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are other informal methods, a professional portfolio manager would likely find them unsatisfactory due to their amateurish nature. Ultimately, a manager seeks to quantify their risk versus the benchmark, something that these other methods cannot achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stratification\n",
    "Stratification, also known as stratified sampling, is a simple method for building portfolios while maintaining a basic risk control mechanism. It was originally developed for statisticians who wanted to understand the characteristics of a population without having to observe every member. The method involves dividing the stock universe into nonoverlapping groups, or strata, based on certain characteristics, such as industry or size. From each stratum, a proportion of stocks is chosen to create a representative sample of the universe, while minimizing risk exposure across multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use stratification for portfolio management, the portfolio manager would first predict the excess returns of all stocks in the universe and then aim to choose high-alpha stocks while controlling risk versus the benchmark. After dividing the stock universe into strata, the manager would select representative stocks from each stratum based on some criterion, such as z-score or expected return. Suppose the stock universe is categorized by sectors and the portfolio manager needs to select four stocks from the transportation sector. In that case, the manager may opt to choose the stocks with the highest ranking based on future risk-adjusted returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although stratification provides a simple way to control risk through broad diversification, it lacks a precise, quantitative control mechanism. Professional portfolio managers may be hesitant to use stratification as it does not allow them to precisely quantify the risks they are taking. Overall, while stratification can be an effective method for some portfolio managers, it may not be the best solution for all.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Factor exposure targeting\n",
    "One method of aligning the portfolio with the benchmark is to target the benchmark's factor exposures as the desired factor exposures for the portfolio. Alternatively, the portfolio's overall beta relative to the benchmark can be set to approximately 1. This ensures that the portfolio closely tracks the benchmark's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beta of a portfolio relative to its benchmark is calculated as the weighted average of the betas of the individual stocks in the portfolio. Specifically, let β be an $N$-dimensional column vector representing the benchmark beta of each stock, where $β_i$ is the beta of stock $i$ with respect to the benchmark. The portfolio beta is then given by the product of the transpose of the portfolio weight vector, $w^\\top$, and $β$. To ensure that the portfolio beta aligns with the benchmark, one approach is to set a constraint on the portfolio beta, such as requiring it to fall within a specified range: $0.9 \\le w^\\top β\\le 1.1$. Alternatively, we could add a constraint to the optimization problem directly: $ w^\\top β=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To expand on the concept of targeting a portfolio's benchmark beta, we can also specify a range for each of the portfolio's other factor exposures. This is known as **factor tilting**, where the portfolio is adjusted to increase exposure to certain factors and decrease exposure to others based on market conditions and our view on the factors. For example, if a portfolio manager believes the market will rally, they may wish to have a higher market beta than the benchmark while keeping other factor exposures equal to the benchmark, thus tilting the portfolio towards the market factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor exposure of a portfolio is determined by the weighted average of the factor exposures of individual stocks. We can represent this with an $N \\times K$ matrix $B$, where $K$ is the number of relevant factors, and $β_{i,k}$ is the exposure of stock $i$ to factor $k$. The factor exposure of a portfolio with weight $w$ is simply $B^\\top w$. Therefore, we can add a general factor exposure constraint to ensure the portfolio is tilted towards certain factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning a minimum exposure value (such as 0.9) to a particular factor, the portfolio manager can express their management style and orient the portfolio towards certain types of investments. For example, setting the first element of β to 0.9 for the growth factor would tilt the portfolio towards growth investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tracking-error minimization\n",
    "Portfolio managers who use benchmarks often use the minimization of tracking error (TE) approach to construct their portfolios. There are two methods to formulate this optimization problem: \n",
    "* one approach minimizes the TE given an expected excess return over the benchmark, \n",
    "* while the other maximizes the expected excess return over the benchmark subject to a maximum TE constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize TE, portfolio managers use the standard deviation ($s$) of portfolio returns minus benchmark returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TE}=s(r_P-r_B)=\\sqrt{V(r_P-r_B)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "They typically use all TE constraints available to them as long as they enhance the expected excess return over the benchmark. These constraints vary from portfolio to portfolio and range from 0.5% to 10% per annum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic optimization framework discussed earlier applies to tracking-error minimization, and only minor adjustments are necessary for the optimization problem. To find a portfolio that minimizes the tracking error \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(r_P-r_B)=V(r_P)-2C(r_P,r_B)+V(r_B),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we minimize the variance of portfolio returns minus twice the covariance between portfolio returns and benchmark returns (e.g., $V(r_P)-2C(r_P,r_B)$) because we cannot control the variance of the benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the portfolio that minimizes tracking error, we need to solve the quadratic minimization problem. The same quadratic programming routine used in the preceding section can solve this problem as well. Typically, the chosen portfolio mean $μ_P$ will be some excess return **over** the benchmark. Practically, we should think of $μ_P$ as the expected return of the benchmark plus a small amount ($μ_P=μ_B+\\delta$) that we add according to our desire, and then run the optimization to find the portfolio weights.\n",
    "Hence,\n",

    "\n",
    "with $\\gamma^\\top = (C(r_1,r_B),\\cdots, C(r_N,r_B))$.\n",
    "Finally, we can add various additional constraints, such as the short-sale, diversification, and style constraints, as in the case of a portfolio with no benchmark.\n",

    "# Advanced Techniques for Quadratic Optimization\n",
    "While the basic techniques covered in this chapter address most portfolio optimization problems, there are scenarios where the optimization setup needs to be expanded. For instance, a portfolio manager may need to factor in transaction costs or create a market-neutral portfolio with leverage constraints. Other situations may involve restrictions on the number of stocks in the portfolio, where the number falls between a minimum and maximum or where the weights of any security are either zero or within a minimum and maximum weight. These and other preferences in the optimization require an expanded optimization framework. Additionally, some portfolio optimization problems may involve quadratic constraints, which are not part of the typical optimization framework. In this section, we will discuss the fundamental building blocks for expanding the optimization framework to address these advanced optimization scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phantom weights\n",
    "In standard portfolio optimization problems, we typically only have $N$ unknowns, which are the portfolio weights. However, in certain nonstandard portfolio problems, it can be useful to introduce what we call \"phantom weights.\" The idea of phantom weights is to create additional weights, in addition to the actual weights of the portfolio, that the optimizer will also find optimal values for. These additional weights can be used for various purposes, such as creating a set of buy and sell weights. For example, if the optimization problem has $N$ stocks, we can create an additional $2N$ weights, denoted as $b_1$ to $b_N$ and $s_1$ to $s_N$. With these additional weights, the new optimization problem becomes more complex, as we now have $3N$ weights to choose from. However, phantom weights offer many benefits in portfolio optimization. Often, the phantom weights have a specific relationship to the underlying weights, such as $b + s = 1$, where $b$ and $s$ are the buy and sell weights, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary weights\n",
    "In portfolio optimization, it may be beneficial to use binary variables as optimization weights in addition to phantom weights. Binary variables are weights that are constrained to have a value of either 0 or 1. One practical application of binary variables is to ensure that phantom weights are orthogonal. This is important because having both a long position and a short position on the same stock (i.e., $b>0$ and $s>0$) is a wasteful solution. By creating binary variables and for each of the $N$ stocks, we can add a constraint to force the phantom weights to be orthogonal. The constraint can be formulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate binary variables as optimization weights, one can create $v_i^+$ and $v_i^-$ binary variables for each of the $N$ stocks. By adding the constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& v_i^+\\kappa_l \\le b_i \\le v_i^+\\kappa_h \\\\\n",
    "& v_i^-\\gamma_l \\le s_i \\le v_i^-\\gamma_h \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and setting $\\kappa_l = \\gamma_l = 0$ and $\\kappa_h = \\gamma_h = 1$, the weights can fluctuate between 0 and 1, and the constraint $v_i^++v_i^-\\le 1$ ensures that the phantom weights are orthogonal. If $b_i>0$, then $s_i=0$ and vice versa for every stock $i$. However, the addition of binary and phantom weights and their associated constraints makes the optimization problem more complex and challenging to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market neutrality with leverage constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the following constraints to the optimization problem will create a market-neutral portfolio that is dollar neutral and has limited leverage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& w_i = w_i^{+} - w_i^{-} \\\\\n",
    "& \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^+ = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^-\\\\\n",
    "& w_i^+ \\ge 0\\\\\n",
    "& w_i^- \\ge 0\\\\\n",
    "& \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^+ + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^- \\le 2\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i^{+}=b_i$ and $w_i^{-}=s_i$.\n",
    "These constraints ensure that the sum of the weights of the long stocks equals the sum of the weights of the shorted stocks, creating a dollar-neutral portfolio. The leverage of the portfolio is limited to 2, meaning that the portfolio is 100% long and 100% short of the assets under management.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the market-neutral manager wanted to increase the leverage, they could adjust the constraints on the sum of the phantom long and short weights. For example, to create a 130-30 long-short portfolio, one could set $L_l = 1.3$ and $L_s = 0.3$ in the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^+=L_l\\\\\n",
    "& \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N w_i^-=L_s\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This would result in a portfolio with long exposure of 130% and short exposure of 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transactions costs\n",
    "When we want to rebalance a portfolio while considering transaction costs (or market impact), we can use phantom weights and binary variables to find an exact solution to the portfolio optimization problem. To do this, we need to add constraints to the optimization problem that consider the current weights of the portfolio represented by $w_b$ and the target weights after rebalancing represented by $w_a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_i^a = w_i^b+w_i^+-w_i^-\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the binary variables and the phantom weights is set such that $\\kappa_l = \\gamma_l = 0$ and $\\kappa_h = \\gamma_h = 1$, which allows the weights to fluctuate between 0 and 1. We also add the constraint that $v_i^++v_i^-\\le 1$ to ensure the phantom weights are orthogonal. Stocks that have reduced weight from the prior portfolio will have negative net weights but positive phantom weights, denoted by $w_i^-$. We can multiply the transactions cost vector by their value. Conversely, stocks that have increased weight will have positive phantom weights, denoted by $w_i^+$, and can also be multiplied by the transactions cost vector. The final optimized weights of the portfolio will be $w_i$. In the case of transaction costs, the phantom weights serve as a mechanism to denote the change to the current weights, storing the positive changes in the positive phantom weights and the negative changes in the negative phantom weights. Both positive and negative phantom weights are positive, so the transaction cost vector remains positive, and the transaction cost rebalance problem is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elimination of small-weight stocks\n",
    "Portfolio managers may want to reduce the number of securities in their portfolio, which can be achieved by constructing an optimized portfolio that forces individual stock weights to be above a minimum or below a maximum weight. However, the traditional method of adding inequality constraints to optimize weights may not always result in a solution, as it forces all stocks to be within a given range, which may not be optimal. The use of binary variables can create an optimization that limits the optimizer to find weights between the minimum and maximum or forces the weight of a particular stock to zero. This results in more successful optimizations and aligns better with the portfolio manager's thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, we will focus on the situation where all stock weights should be between a lower bound ($\\kappa_l$) and an upper bound ($\\kappa_h$) for the long portion of the portfolio. Using the inequality relationship of the binary variables and phantom weights, we can set $v_i^+\\kappa_l \\le b_i \\le v_i^+\\kappa_h$ and $v_i^-\\gamma_l \\le s_i \\le v_i^-\\gamma_h$. Once we specify the values for $\\kappa_l$, $\\gamma_l$, $\\kappa_h$, and $\\gamma_h$, we can effectively achieve our goal. If the portfolio is only a long portfolio, phantom weights are not needed, and we should construct one set of binary variables with respect to the actual weights, $w_i$. The binary variables can be either 0 or 1, and the weights of the portfolio will be selected to be within the minimum and maximum weights or set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A numerical example\n",
    "Building upon the previous numerical example, we aim to construct a portfolio that delivers an average annualized return of 8% without short sales and with the restriction that the weights of the portfolio must sum to 1. We further impose the constraint that the weight of each stock can only be greater than 0.03 (i.e., 3%) or less than 0.30 (i.e., 30%), or it must be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent these constraints mathematically, we construct the matrix A, where the first two rows denote equality constraints that the sum of weights should equal 1 and that the target mean return is 8%. Since binary weights are not relevant for these constraints, we place 0 in the corresponding matrix elements. The remaining rows of the matrix are inequality constraints that restrict the weights of each stock to lie between 0.03 and 0.30 or be 0. We use the values of $\\kappa_l$ and $\\kappa_h$ to ensure that $0.03v_i^+ \\le w_i \\le 0.3v_i^+$, where $v_i^+$ is a binary variable. If $v_i^+$ equals 1, the weight of stock $i$ must lie within the range of 0.03 to 0.30. Otherwise, if it is more optimal for the weight of stock $i$ to be 0, then $v_i^+= 0$, and $w_i$ is also equal to 0."

    "If the managers are only limiting the number of stocks, binary variables will suffice. For a long-only portfolio, the managers should create a set of $N$ binary variables, $v_i^+$, while for a long-short portfolio, they should create two sets of binary variables, $v_i^+$ and $v_i^-,$ allowing them to specify the range of stocks in both the long and short portfolios, respectively. To ensure that the number of stocks in the long portfolio is within the specified range, two inequality constraints should be added. The first constraint is that $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^Nv_i^+ \\leq n_h$, while the second constraint is that $n_l \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^Nv_i^+$. For optimization frameworks that require it, the second inequality can be transformed into $-\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^Nv_i^+ \\leq -n_l$. Similarly, for a long-short portfolio, the portfolio manager should add similar constraints on the short portfolio using the corresponding binary variables.\n",

    "Continuing from the previous example, our goal is to construct a portfolio with an average annualized return of 8%, without short sales and with the portfolio weights summing to 1. However, we want to restrict the portfolio to have no more than three stocks, despite having six stocks available for purchase.\n",
