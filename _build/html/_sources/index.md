# Data-Driven Methods in Finance

The Data-Driven Methods in Finance (DDMIF) course provides a comprehensive education in using data for quantitative research in finance and trading. It aims to equip students with the systematic and statistical skills to analyze and make informed data-driven decisions. Upon completion, students will have the practical skills and strategic viewpoint to optimize information and make data-driven decisions in finance. The curriculum includes hands-on experience and prepares students to apply their learning in real-world financial situations.

The course content is based on multiple sources, but with a primary focus on the book [Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management, Second Edition: An Active Approach to Portfolio Construction and Management](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Equity-Portfolio-Management-Second/dp/1264268920). This book offers a systematic approach to portfolio construction and management using data-driven methods, making it an ideal foundation for the DDMIF course.
In addition to the primary textbook, the course also draws on resources from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1071614177/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YYMKPXF419FM&keywords=An+Introduction+to+Statistical+Learning&qid=1675135896&s=books&sprefix=an+introduction+to+statistical+learning%2Cstripbooks%2C718&sr=1-1). This book provides an in-depth introduction to statistical learning techniques and their applications in various fields, including finance.
Finally, the DDMIF course also leverages resources from [Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics](https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/). This book covers the basics of computational finance and financial econometrics, and provides students with a solid foundation in these fields.

**The course material relies exclusively on the aforementioned textbooks.** It does not offer investment advice or pre-constructed trading algorithms and does not represent the views of the author, associated entities, or agencies. The objective is to emphasize the challenges that Data Science and Machine Learning methods encounter when working with financial data. These difficulties, such as a brief history, non-stationarity, shifts in market conditions, and low signal content, make it challenging to attain robust outcomes. The topics covered serve as a reference for using these methods to make informed investment decisions through a systematic and scientific approach.
